# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

1. With more time, I would have liked to get more familiar with Material UI and I would have liked to work on the overall look more as I mainly focused on the functionality in my 2 hours

2. I would also have liked to complete the 5th task of adding a cache for repeat searches, ideally I would have some conditional logic in my search component where if the user's latest input is identical to the current searchInput state, then the API call would be forgoed and no change would need to occur.

3. With more time I would have added more error handling for areas that don't exist so that the user knows that they either have made an error with their input or that the outcode is not linked to any specific area.

4. I would also liked to make my components more controlled in that the inputs are contained within the components and only used to update state when needed.
